📡 DTH Course Registration System
This project is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the registration process for Direct-To-Home (DTH) training courses. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend, it offers a clean, responsive interface and robust backend logic to manage course listings, user registrations, and data persistence.
🎯 Purpose
The goal of this system is to simplify how users discover and enroll in DTH-related courses, whether they’re technicians, service providers, or learners looking to upskill. Inspired by real-world platforms like OLX and educational portals, this project demonstrates how modern web technologies can be used to build scalable, user-friendly solutions for vocational training.
